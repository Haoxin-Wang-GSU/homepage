IEEE INFOCOM is a top-ranked conference on networking in the research community. It is a major conference venue for researchers to present and exchange significant and innovative contributions and ideas in the field of networking and closely related areas. IEEE INFOCOM covers both theoretical and systems research. For INFOCOM 2023, the conference includes a main technical program, a number of workshops, a keynote speech, panels, a student poster session, and demo/poster sessions.

Due to residual logistic issues associated with the COVID pandemic, INFOCOM 2023 conference site has been moved to the New York area, USA (from Tokyo, Japan) with new meeting dates of May 17-20, 2023. INFOCOM 2023 will be offered in hybrid mode with the in-person conference to be held on the beautiful campus of Stevens Institute of Technology, across the Hudson river from Manhattan, New York City. After holding INFOCOM virtually for three years, we are excited to be able to offer in-person experience of INFOCOM to our attendees in 2023.
