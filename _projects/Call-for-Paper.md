**Special Issue Information**

Dear Colleagues,

Next-generation networks and computing systems aim to provide pervasive, extremely low-latency, ultra-reliable, and trustworthy communication and computation services for diverse use cases and services, including augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), autonomous driving, vehicle-to-everything (V2X), internet of things (IoT), smart grids, industry 4.0 and precise agriculture. The exponential expansion of devices (e.g., phones, sensors, and vehicles), infrastructures (cellular and WiFi), and services extremely complicate the control and management of the system, which demands new approaches and methodologies.

The advances in machine learning in recent years, e.g., deep neural networks, deep learning, and deep reinforcement learning, show great potential for resolving the challenges under high-dimensional states and network dynamics. Machine learning can enable intelligent wireless communication (e.g., waveform, coding, and receivers), networking (e.g., congestion control and load balancing), and computing (e.g., scheduling and resource provision) in a broad range of scenarios. Nevertheless, the application of machine learning in next-generation networks and computing systems still needs further investigations in terms of robustness, scalability, availability, explainability, transformability, adaptability, and so on.

This Special Issue will focus on machine learning solutions to address the problems in next-generation networks and computing systems. The topics of interest include but are not limited to machine learning, especially deep learning and deep reinforcement learning, for resource management, congestion control, routing, signal processing, computation offloading, joint communication and sensing, and traffic modeling.

This Special Issue, “Machine Learning for Next-Generation Wireless Networks and Computing Systems”, will solicit research papers on various disciplines, including but not limited to the following:

- machine learning for network resource management;
- machine learning for physical layer wireless communication;
- machine learning for transport-layer congestion control;
- machine learning for computation offloading;
- machine learning for traffic engineering;
- machine learning for reconfigurable intelligent surface design;
- machine learning for distributed resource provisioning;
- machine learning for network slicing;
- machine learning for quality-of-service (QoS) assurance;
- machine learning for emerging applications, e.g., autonomous driving, augmented reality, and unmanned aerial vehicles;
- machine learning for emerging scenarios, e.g., edge computing, precise agriculture, and smart cities.
