### 🍜 Noodles & Ramen 🍜

As a Lanzhou native, beef noodle is my "Soul Mate". I tried some Lanzhou noodle restaurants in the USA and Japan. I found some of them are authentic and would love to share with you if you want to give it a shot.

- 👍 馬子禄牛肉面 神保町店: 1 Chome-3-18 Kanda Jinbocho, Chiyoda City, Tokyo 101-0051, Japan
- 👍 Highland Noodles 金城兰州拉面: 1720 N Milpitas Blvd, Milpitas, CA 95035

I've started loving Ramen since I travelled in Japan. Also, it is much easier to find a good Japanese Ramen restaurant in the USA, especially in CA. Two of my best-loved Ramen restaurants:

- 👍 Ramen Hajime: 5229 Stevens Creek Blvd, Santa Clara, CA 95051
- 👍 Orenchi Ramen: 3540 Homestead Rd, Santa Clara, CA 95051
